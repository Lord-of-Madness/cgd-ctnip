Save system to work requires:
- an object in the scene with the "SaveSystem" script attached
- all the relative objects which are saved to:
	a) fullfill the ISaveable interface
	b) be added via the SaveSystem.AddSaveable(object) to the SaveSystem list
	c) have their own serializable data struct in the SaveSystem ready which is part of the SaveSystem.AllSavedData structure
	d) in Save/Load function from the interface, handle the saving to structure and loading from it functionally
- some button, which calls the SaveSystem.Save/Load() functions
